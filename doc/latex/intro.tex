\section{Scope of this document}

	This document describes the commands and functions available to
	operators in SporksIRCD, as used on
	\htmladdnormallink{SporksMoo}{http://sporksmoo.net}.

	This document, and various ideas for features of charybdis, have
	been taken from dancer-{}ircd/hyperion, the ircd used on freenode,
	mainly written by Andrew Suffield and Jilles Tjoelker.

	While this document may be of some interest to the users of SporksIRCd
	servers, it is intended as a reference for network staff.


\section{About this document}
	This document is largely based on the charybdis documentation, although
	edited to document differences. It was converted from SGML docbook to
	LaTeX format via dblatex by Elizabeth Jennifer Myers (and subsequently
	cleaned up by her). Andrew Wilcox did most of the heavy lifting of
	getting the markup in a usable state and also aided with cleanup.

	The HTML LaTeX version of these docs are generated by html2latex. A
	regularly updated (about every 3 hours) HTML version can be found
	\htmladdnormallink{here}{http://gewt.net/~init/sporksircd-docs}.


\section{About SporksIRCD}
	SporksIRCD is based on ShadowIRCd (in turn based on Charybdis which is
	based on ircd-{}ratbox 3.0.0), although much has changed.
	\htmladdnormallink{ircd-{}ratbox}{http://www.ircd-ratbox.org} is
	commonly used on efnet, and some other networks.
	\htmladdnormallink{Charybdis}{http://www.stack.nl/~jilles/irc/\#charybdis}
	is used on \htmladdnormallink{StaticBox}{http://staticbox.org} and
	\htmladdnormallink{SorceryNet}{http://www.sorcery.net/}; a close
	derivative, ircd-seven, is used on freenode (although usage of
	ircd-seven by the public is discouraged). ShadowIRCD is used on
	\htmladdnormallink{ThinStack}{http://thinstack.net} and a few other
	networks.
