ROLEPLAY consists of a number of similar commands
all of which send messages to channel under 'fake'
nicknames. The user of the command can be identified
by looking at the ident of the 'fake' user - it will
always be the nickname of the person using the command,
and the host will always be npc.fakeuser.invalid. These
commands require the target channel to be set +N, and
obey the same restrictions as regular PRIVMSG.

Roleplay commands from normal users have the nick 
underlined, to clearly show that the message is a
roleplay message rather than a normal one (with one
exception). Network operators are not subject to this 
restriction.

NPC <nick> <channel> :message
Sends a standard roleplay message to #channel with the 
nick specified. 

NPCA <nick> <channel> :message
Sends an ACTION to #channel with the nick and message
specified. 

SCENE <channel> :message
The same as NPC, except the message always originates
from the nickname =Scene=, which will not be underlined
like the other commands.
