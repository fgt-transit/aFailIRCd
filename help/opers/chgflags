CHGFLAGS <nick> <flags>

Changes the given user's auth {} block flags on-the-fly. Normally changing them
would require a reconnect of the client. Note, however, all changes will go
away when the client reconnects. To make them permanent, you should create an
auth {} block for the user in ircd.conf.

For more information on what the flags do, see reference.conf.

Supported flags: kline_exempt spambot_exempt shide_exempt jupe_exempt
                 resv_exempt flood_exempt
