GRANT <nick> <privset>

Grants the given user the set of privileges specified by privset. Note that
this requires the oper:grant privilege.

Any privileges granted by GRANT will be lost when the user disconnects. Users
can also still regain oper if their oper block is in effect. It is highly
advised, therefore, that this only be used as a temporary or transient measure.
