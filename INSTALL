===============================================================================
HOW TO BUILD:

1) Read the NEWS file to find out about the exciting new features in this
   version. Other good reads are doc/example.conf, and README.FIRST.

2) Run the configure script. It will create include/setup.h and the Makefiles
   to match your system. Paths are handled with the --prefix option to
   to configure. $HOME/ircd is the default if no prefix is specified.

   Note: There are some special optional parameters to the configure script
   that some admins may wish to use.

   * --enable-kqueue - Use the superior kqueue(2) system call as opposed to the
     default poll(2). This is available on modern NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.

   * --enable-devpoll - Enable the superior /dev/poll support on Solaris.

   * --enable-epoll - Enable the superior Linux Edge-Triggered Polling system.
     This is currently only available on 2.5 Linux kernel versions or later.

   * --enable-openssl - Enable the openssl dependent crypto functions. This
     will allow CHALLENGE to work and encrypted links, among other things. On
     systems where the configure script can automatically detect OpenSSL, this
     option is not necessary. If configure cannot find OpenSSL, you must
     specify a path with this option (--enable-openssl=/path/to/openssl)

   * --enable-ipv6 - Enable IPv6 support. This will be the default in the near
     future.

   * --disable-assert - Disable some of the debugging code. This should be used
     on all production servers for maximum speed and to prevent cores from
     things that shouldn't normally happen.

   * --enable-small-net - Tunes the server for smaller networks by reducing the
     startup memory footprint. This should really only be used for *small*
     networks (< 500 users), as this tends to be a performance hit on larger
     networks.

   * --with-nicklen=LENGTH - Sets the maximum NICK length. Note that this must
     be consistent across your entire network.

   * --with-topiclen=LENGTH - Sets the maximum TOPIC length. Note that this
     must be consistent across your entire network.

3) make should build ircd.

4) make install will install the server, modules, and tools in the prefix
   specified when configure was run.

5) If you wish to enable the user log, oper log, and failed oper log, issue
   these commands at the shell prompt (in the prefix directory):

   $ touch logs/userlog
   $ touch logs/operlog
   $ touch logs/foperlog

   Note: If you use different names in ircd.conf, you must 'touch' the specific
   names.

HOW TO GET HELP

The best way to get help regarding bugs and such is by asking on our IRC
channel which is at irc://irc.sporksirc.net/#sporksircd.

===============================================================================
NOTES

The best way to get a backtrace of the core is to follow this sequence of
instructions:

1) Change to the directory containing the core file

2) Run gdb on the binary and the core file. With an unmodified SporksIRCD
   installation, an example command line is below (in the $HOME/ircd
   directory):

   $ gdb bin/ircd ircd.core

3) At the "(gdb)" prompt, enter the command "bt"

4) Save the output of the backtrace command to a pastebin of some sort (such as
   http://slexy.org) and give it to us on our IRC channel.

5) Be sure to save the ircd binary, the modules, and the core file in a safe
   place in case the developers need to look deeper than a backtrace provides.
